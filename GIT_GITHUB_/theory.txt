Version Control system :: (VCS)

        Version control system is a tool that helps manage changes to files, specially 
        source code.

        -> in simple word we can say that it keeps track of every changes 
        -> it allows you to go back to previous version if something goes wrong. 
        -> it allows multiple pepole to work together on the same project without 
            overwriting each other's work. collaboration

--------------------------------------------
popular version control systems software. 

1) Git : most widely used (used with Github,gitlab,bitbucket)
        - which provide branching and merging 
        - git which is a tool which manage all above things and github 
        which provide hosting.
2) SVN : subversion
3) Mercurial 
-------------------------------------------
what is Github ? 
    -> Cloud base version control hosting platform. 
    -> which is provide hosting service. 
    -> which is store all repositories online. 

-------------------------------------------
Now, configure Git (version system tool) to Github (hosting platform)

==> open git bash and check git version 

    #git --version 

==> now, configure Git with Github 

    #git config --global user.name "yourname"
    #git config --global user.email "email" 

    e.g. 

    #git config --global user.name "enji-coder"
    #git config --global user.email "enji.20.patel@gmail.com" 

==> to check all configuration list 

    #git config --list 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git workflow ::

    -> Working directory 
            -------------> 
            #git add 
                        Stagging Area 
                        --------------->
                        git commit 
                                        local repo 
                                        ----------->
                                        git push                 
                                                -------> remote repo


stagging area : temporary area where we can store our local repo. 
        before commit it store in stagging area 
        after commit it move to local repo. 
        then after push visible on remote repo. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Link local git repo to github 

==> create local folder 

    #mkdir my-first-project 

    #cd my-first-project 

    #git init 

    #echo "my content" > filename.txt 

    #git add . 

    #git commit -m "remarks" 
        here, -m means message 

    #git branch -M main 
        here, we are changing our branch name master to main 

    #git remote add origin <repourl> 
        e.g. 

        #git remote add origin https://github.com/enji-coder/my-demo-project.git

    #git push -u origin master  or main  
        if we do first time git push -u origin main then it save your main branch for next time 

        and next time you can use only 

        #git push 
            and it will work properly 

----------------------------------------
.gitignore : A .gitignore file tells git which files or folders 
    it should ignore - means it will not track - not add in stagging area 
    after commit it will skip thoese files which declare inside the gitignore file. 

    *.css   : means ignore all css file not upload any css file 
    folder/ : ignore that directory and inside the directory files 

    Real world use : node_modules , env file which contain api keys , password etc.. 
----------------------------------------
git restore : this command usually work in 2 places 

    1) working tree (working directory when we are working upon it 
            before execute git add command
            )

    2) stagging area (index area) : we can move back to previous code 
            using of git restore command. 


    ==> before stagging - just creating file and try to remove 

        e.g. we are creating index.html 

        adding <h1>... </h1> 

        save it commit it 

        then add one more line 

                <p>....</p>

        and close your directory now, you don't want to add past record 
            note : which is not in stagging area 

        #git restore .  
            above command remove that <p> ... </p> line 

    ==> stagging area :: before commit area 

        # git restore --staged file.txt 

        (before commit) it will work 
=============================================================
Git Revert ::: Git revert is a safe way to undo changes in git repositories.

    it doesn't delete or rewrite commits 
    insted of it create new commit that undoes the changes made by earlier one. 

    syntax ::: 

    #git revert <commit_id> 


    Note : whenever we push our code on github every time it create unique hash key 
        encryption key. 
        top corner right click on commits 

        so, using of this hash code (commit code) we can move to back any commit point 

    #git log 
        to check recent git logs with commit code 

    e.g. 

    # git revert 66ca554

    # git push 

    Note : now, you can check revert back changes apply on github and now, we can access
        anywhere.

        Good things about revert is it remain previous commit history + own commit revert history
